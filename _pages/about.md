Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are hands-on cybersecurity challenges where participants solve
tasks from areas like web security, reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography. Our team brings
together students and security enthusiasts from across the ZHAW community to learn and collaborate.

Whether you’re new to CTFs, sharpening your offensive security skills, or looking for a team to grow
with, you’re in the right place. We explore everything from web exploitation and reverse engineering to
forensics, cryptography, and more—one flag at a time.

Join us, level up your skills, and take part in a community built on teamwork,
learning, and a shared passion for security.
