Writing a clear and well-structured CTF write-up is one of the best ways to improve your skills and contribute
to the cybersecurity community. For newcomers, the process can feel a bit unclear at first—what should you
document, how detailed should it be, and how do others typically format their solutions?
This guide breaks down a simple, consistent structure you can follow for any challenge. It helps you capture your
thought process, document the tools and steps you used, and present your solution in a way that’s helpful both for
yourself later on and for others learning from your work.

## Template Structure

- Challenge Overview
  - **Challenge Name:**
  - **Category:** (Web, Crypto, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, etc.)
  - **Difficulty:**
  - **Description:**
  - **Provided Files / URL:**
- Goal: Describe the objective of the challenge and what you need to obtain (usually the flag).
- Initial Analysis: Explain your first steps
  - What you examined first
  - Any assumptions or hypotheses
  - Tools used for reconnaissance
- Solution Path: Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how you solved the challenge:
  - Commands, scripts, or code snippets
  - Screenshots (optional)
  - Dead ends or mistakes you made along the way
- Flag Capture: Show the final step that produced the flag.
  - **Important:** Do not share flags publicly if the CTF rules prohibit it or the event is still running.
  - Flag: `flag{example_flag_here}`
- Conclusion: Summarize what you learned from the challenge and any tips for others attempting it.
