Preparation for the next Pizza Hacking Night are in full swing, and we are excited to announce that new swag
is now available for our team members!

We are thrilled to unveil our latest collection of team swag, designed to showcase our ZHAW CTF spirit. Sponsored by the
Institute of Computer Science at ZHAW, we recently received a fresh batch of coffee mugs. Perfect for fueling late-night
coding sessions or simply enjoying your favorite beverage, these mugs are a great way to represent our team.
