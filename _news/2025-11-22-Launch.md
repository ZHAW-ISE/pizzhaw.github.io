We’ve launched our new website to share updates, events, and resources from the ZHAW CTF Team. More content and
activities will follow soon.

We’re pleased to introduce the new online home of the ZHAW Capture the Flag (CTF) Team. The site brings together all
essential information about who we are, what we do, and how students can get involved in cybersecurity activities at ZHAW.

The goal of this platform is to provide updates on upcoming CTF events, team activities, achievements, and resources for
anyone interested in hands-on security challenges. Whether you’re completely new to CTFs or already experienced, the
website will serve as a central place to follow our progress and stay informed.

More content will be added over the coming weeks, including details on regular meetings, training sessions, and how to
join the team. We’re excited to grow the community and continue strengthening practical cybersecurity skills across ZHAW.

Stay tuned—more updates coming soon.
